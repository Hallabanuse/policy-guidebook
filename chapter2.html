        <h1>Chapter 2: Assessing the Policy Context</h1>

        <div class="opening">
            <p>
                Before engaging in advocacy, you need to understand your
                context. What is the state of the problem you want to address?
                Who are the key decision-makers and what drives their
                priorities? What policy solutions already exist or are being
                developed? And critically: is your team positioned to engage
                effectively?
            </p>
            <p>
                This chapter provides tools for answering these questions. It
                introduces a practical approach to policy context assessment
                based on the three streams described in Chapter 1—problems,
                politics, and policies. The Policy Context Tool helps you
                systematically analyse these streams to identify where
                conditions are favourable, where barriers exist, and when policy
                windows might open.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Starting points</h3>

        <p>Teams come to policy engagement through different paths:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A <strong>conservation team</strong> using the Conservation
                Standards may identify "inadequate regulatory framework" or
                "weak enforcement" as a contributing factor in their
                <em>situation model</em>—and realise they need to understand the
                political landscape to address it.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <strong>policy team</strong> may spot a political
                opportunity—an upcoming election, a scheduled policy review—or
                be responding to a regulatory threat that affects their work.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Whatever the entry point, the challenge is the same: understanding
            the political context well enough to act strategically. Recognising
            that policy matters is not the same as knowing how to engage
            effectively. What are the conditions that would make policy change
            possible? Is the problem recognised by decision-makers? Are there
            political actors who might champion this cause? Do feasible policy
            solutions exist? When might a window of opportunity open?
        </p>

        <p>
            The Policy Context Tool introduced in this chapter helps answer
            these questions. It provides a structured way to assess the
            political environment—building on the three streams framework from
            Chapter 1—so that teams can identify where conditions are
            favourable, where barriers exist, and when windows might open.
        </p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Start with your own readiness.</strong> Before
                    assessing the external landscape, reflect on your team's
                    capacity, expertise, relationships, and credibility. Not
                    every organisation is well-positioned for every advocacy
                    opportunity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Coalitions can fill gaps.</strong> If your team
                    lacks certain capacities, partnerships can help. Coalitions
                    pool resources, increase credibility, and extend reach to
                    decision-makers you cannot access alone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use the three streams as your framework.</strong>
                    The problems, political, and policy streams provide a
                    structured way to assess the context. Various
                    tools—stakeholder analysis, horizon scanning, legal
                    framework analysis—can help you dig deeper into each stream.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assessment informs strategy.</strong> The purpose of
                    assessment is not to produce a report—it is to understand
                    your context well enough to act strategically. Assessment
                    should lead directly to planning (Chapter 3).
                </li>

        <h2>2.1 Your Team and Readiness</h2>

        <p>
            Before diving into external analysis, take stock of your own
            organisation. Advocacy requires specific skills, relationships, and
            resources that may differ from those needed for other conservation
            work.

        <h3>Internal capacity</h3>

        <p>
            An organisation's capacity for advocacy depends on factors
            including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Expertise</strong>: Do you have staff with policy
                knowledge, communication skills, and understanding of the
                political landscape?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Relationships</strong>: Do you have existing connections
                to decision-makers, other advocacy organisations, or communities
                affected by the issue?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Credibility</strong>: Are you seen as a trustworthy
                voice on this issue? How do decision-makers, the public,
                potential partners, and industry perceive you?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Resources</strong>: Do you have the time, funding, and
                staff capacity to sustain an advocacy effort?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Capacity gaps take different forms. Conservation organisations may
            be staffed primarily by field staff and practitioners unfamiliar
            with political processes. Policy teams may have political expertise
            but lack the technical knowledge or field credibility needed for a
            specific issue. Neither is a reason to avoid engagement—but both are
            reasons to be realistic about what capacity-building, partnerships,
            or coalition work might be needed.
        </p>

        <h3>Which level to focus on</h3>

        <p>
            Policy engagement happens at multiple levels—global, regional,
            national, and local. As discussed in Chapter 1, these levels
            interact in complex ways. International commitments create pressure
            for national action; national frameworks shape what is possible
            locally; local implementation determines whether policies achieve
            their intended impact.
        </p>

        <p>
            When assessing your readiness, consider which level best matches
            your:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Existing relationships</strong>: Where do you already
                have connections and credibility?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Geographic or thematic focus</strong>: Where does your
                organisation naturally operate?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Capacity</strong>: Do you have the resources and
                expertise for international processes, or are you better
                positioned for national or local engagement?
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Theory of change</strong>: At which level is the key
                decision actually made? Where is change most likely to happen?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Coalitions and partnerships</h3>

        <p>
            Effective advocacy rarely happens in isolation. Building coalitions
            can help organisations:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Increase influence</strong>: A coordinated message from
                multiple organisations carries more weight than individual
                voices
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pool resources</strong>: Different organisations bring
                different skills, relationships, and capacities
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Expand reach</strong>: Partners may have access to
                decision-makers or communities that you cannot reach alone
            </li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "You have this big stove with a lot of burners, you gotta keep a
                lot of things simmering all at the same time. But be strategic
                in which one you turn up. If it's cold, you can't use it at all.
                And that's where I think you go back to partnerships and
                coalitions—no one can do all the things all the time."

        <h2>2.2 The Policy Context Tool</h2>

        <p>
            The Policy Context Tool provides a structured approach to
            understanding the political environment around a specific issue.
            Based on Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework (introduced in Chapter
            1), it helps teams analyse three streams—problems, politics, and
            policies—and identify where conditions are favourable for advocacy.
        </p>

        <p>The tool can be used in multiple ways:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>By conservation teams</strong> who have identified
                advocacy as a strategy in their project and need to unpack the
                political context around their conservation goals
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>By policy teams</strong> who work on political issues
                regularly and need to decide which policies and strategies to
                prioritise
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Retrospectively</strong> to understand how a particular
                policy outcome occurred and what role policy windows played
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Assessing the problems stream</h3>

        <p>
            In the problems stream, various conditions compete for attention. A
            condition becomes a recognised <em>problem</em> when people believe
            something should be done about it.
        </p>

        <h4>Key aspects to assess:</h4>

        <p>
            <em>Focusing events</em>: Have there been crises, disasters,
            studies, or developments that have drawn attention to this issue?
            Are any such events anticipated?
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Indicators</em>: Is there data showing the condition is
            worsening? Are there systematic measurements that highlight the
            problem?
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Feedback on existing policies</em>: Is there evidence that
            current approaches are failing? Have there been reviews or
            evaluations that highlight shortcomings?
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Problem framing</em>: How is the problem being defined by
            decision-makers and the media? Is it framed as a health issue, an
            economic issue, an environmental issue? Different framings attract
            different attention and suggest different solutions.
        </p>

        <h4>Probing questions:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Was there or is there any scheduled feedback on the functioning
                of the current legal framework?
            </li>
            <li>
                Were there or do we foresee any crises, disasters, studies, or
                developments that change attention for the problem?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is there any indication that the problem has the attention of
                decision-makers?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is the problem framed in a certain way by decision-makers? Does
                the framing differ depending on the person, party, or actor?
            </li>
            <li>
                How much media attention does the problem receive? How is it
                framed?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="evidence-box">
            <p class="evidence-label">Evidence in the problems stream</p>
            <p>
                Evidence is critical here. Data on indicators, studies
                documenting impacts, and evaluations of existing policies help
                establish whether a condition is recognised as a problem—and
                shape how it is framed. Without evidence, you have no case to
                bring to the table.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Assessing the political stream</h3>

        <p>
            In the political stream, decision-makers prioritise and deprioritise
            issues based on political context, interest group pressure, public
            opinion, and personal motivations.
        </p>

        <h4>Key aspects to assess:</h4>

        <p>
            <em>Public opinion</em>: What do different publics think about this
            issue? Is there support or opposition? How organised and vocal are
            relevant groups?
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Interest groups</em>: Who are the key sectors, industries, and
            interest groups that relate to this problem? What are their
            positions? How influential are they?
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Government positions</em>: What is the current government's
            stance? Who are the key decision-makers? What drives their
            priorities—party dynamics, electoral calculations, personal
            interests?
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Political events</em>: What political events are coming up
            (elections, government transitions, appointments) that might affect
            priorities or power distribution?
        </p>

        <h4>Stakeholder analysis</h4>

        <p>
            A <em>stakeholder analysis</em> helps map who is involved, their
            positions, and their influence. The most common approach involves
            two dimensions:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Influence</strong>: A person's or group's capacity to
                affect political agenda-setting
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Alignment</strong>: The extent to which they share your
                goals
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="matrix">
            <pre>
                    HIGH ALIGNMENT
                          │
         Supporters       │        Champions
                          │
                          │
    LOW ──────────────────┼────────────────── HIGH
    INFLUENCE             │               INFLUENCE
                          │
         Bystanders       │        Blockers
                          │
                          │
                    LOW ALIGNMENT</pre
            >
        </div>

        <p>
            <em>Champions</em> are actors with high alignment and high
            influence—your most valuable allies. <em>Blockers</em> have high
            influence but low alignment—they can obstruct your goals and may
            need to be countered or worked around. <em>Supporters</em> share
            your goals but have limited influence—they may benefit from support
            to increase their voice. <em>Bystanders</em> have neither high
            influence nor high alignment—monitor them but don't invest heavily.
        </p>

        <h4>Probing questions:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Who are the key publics? What is their current opinion on the
                topic?
            </li>
            <li>
                How important is public opinion for this topic? Will it strongly
                influence the political agenda?
            </li>
            <li>
                Who are the key interest groups? What are their agendas? How
                organised and influential are they?
            </li>
            <li>
                Who are the key decision-makers? What drives them—party
                dynamics, personal preferences, electoral concerns?
            </li>
            <li>
                What political events are coming up that might affect the
                composition or priorities of the government?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="evidence-box">
            <p class="evidence-label">Evidence in the political stream</p>
            <p>
                Many assume that strong evidence will shift political
                priorities. It rarely does. Political receptivity is shaped by
                elections, public mood, interest groups, and decision-makers'
                motivations—not by data. Focus your assessment here on these
                factors. Evidence becomes valuable later, when a window opens
                and decision-makers are actively looking for solutions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Assessing the policy stream</h3>

        <p>
            In the policy stream, ideas, proposals, and solutions float in a
            "primeval soup" where they are tested, revised, and refined until
            viable options emerge.
        </p>

        <h4>Key aspects to assess:</h4>

        <p>
            <em>Existing policies</em>: What is the current legal and policy
            framework? What policies exist at local, national, regional, and
            international levels?
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Policy solutions under discussion</em>: What proposals are being
            developed or debated? Who is championing them?
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Technical feasibility</em>: Are the proposed solutions
            technically viable? Are there known limitations or gaps?
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Political acceptability</em>: How do key actors view the
            proposed solutions? Are they seen as realistic or controversial?
        </p>

        <h4>Probing questions:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                What is the existing legal framework for this issue at different
                levels?
            </li>
            <li>
                Are there feasible policy solutions available? Do we need more?
                Do we need to improve existing ones?
            </li>
            <li>
                Have similar proposals been discussed before? What happened to
                them?
            </li>
            <li>
                How does the specialised policy community feel about particular
                solutions?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do we foresee any constraints to the political acceptability of
                solutions?
            </li>
            <li>What evidence gaps exist that might need to be addressed?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="evidence-box">
            <p class="evidence-label">Evidence in the policy stream</p>
            <p>
                Evidence is essential for developing and defending solutions. It
                helps establish technical feasibility, anticipate objections,
                and identify gaps that opponents might exploit. Having a
                well-evidenced proposal ready is what allows you to act when a
                window opens.

        <h2>2.3 Putting It Together: PFAS Case Study</h2>

        <div class="case-study-intro">
            <p><strong>About this case study</strong></p>
            <p>
                Throughout this guidebook, we follow a team working on PFAS
                (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) regulation to illustrate
                the concepts and tools in practice. In this chapter, the team
                assesses their policy context. In Chapter 3, they develop their
                engagement strategy. In Chapter 4, they design their approach to
                measuring progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team came to policy engagement through the Conservation
                Standards—but the methods they use apply regardless of your
                starting point.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            This section shows how the team applied the Policy Context Tool to
            understand the political landscape around PFAS regulation.
        </p>

        <h3>The issue and entry point</h3>

        <p>
            PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are synthetic chemicals
            that persist in the environment and accumulate in living organisms.
            They are found in drinking water, food, and everyday products.
        </p>

        <p>
            This particular team arrived at policy engagement through a
            Conservation Standards situation analysis. As part of Step 1
            ('Assess'), they developed a <em>situation model</em>—a visual
            representation mapping the causal chain from contributing factors
            through direct threats to impacts on biodiversity and human
            wellbeing (Figure 2.1).
        </p>

        <p>
            The situation model revealed that "inadequate regulatory framework"
            was a key contributing factor driving PFAS contamination. But
            identifying this gap was only the first step. To address it, the
            team needed to understand the political context: What would it
            actually take to strengthen PFAS regulation?
        </p>

                Figure 2.1: Situation model for PFAS contamination. The model
                identifies "inadequate regulatory framework" as a contributing
                factor—the starting point for this team's policy context
                assessment.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>What the situation model showed</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Focal values</strong> include freshwater ecosystems, soil
            biodiversity, and coastal/marine ecosystems, as well as human
            wellbeing targets such as safe drinking water, food safety, and
            economic livelihoods.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Direct threats</strong> are all forms of PFAS pollution
            (IUCN-CMP Category 9.1: Water-Borne Pollution):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Industrial PFAS discharge from manufacturing facilities</li>
            <li>Application of contaminated biosolids on agricultural land</li>
            <li>
                Use of PFAS firefighting foams at military bases and airports
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Biophysical factors</strong> show how these threats affect
            ecosystems: surface water contamination, soil contamination,
            groundwater contamination, and bioaccumulation through food chains.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Contributing factors</strong> reveal the drivers behind
            these threats—and this is where policy becomes visible:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Inadequate regulatory framework</em>: Only 12 of
                approximately 10,000 PFAS compounds are currently regulated
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Weak sludge regulations</em>: Inadequate controls on
                biosolids application
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Polluter-pays principle not enforced</em>: Costs fall on the
                public and water utilities (estimated €18 billion annually)
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Chemical industry influence</em>: Lobbying against strict
                regulations
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The situation model also identifies opportunities: a restriction
            proposal is under development at EU level, new drinking water limits
            are coming in 2026, public support for a ban exceeds 75%, and water
            utilities are well organised as advocates.
        </p>

        <h3>Applying the Policy Context Tool</h3>

        <p>
            With the situation model complete, the team turns to the Policy
            Context Tool. Their goal is to reduce PFAS threats to biodiversity
            and human wellbeing—but to do that, they need to understand the
            political landscape.

                concerns. The incoming conservative government is likely
                attentive to constituents in electoral districts worried about
                polluted drinking water. However, the chemical industry has
                significant influence and is actively working to shape the new

                <em>Assessment</em>: A viable policy solution already exists at

                to ensure national support for the ongoing EU process. The main
                risk is that industry successfully reframes the debate before
                the new government forms its position.

        <h3>Identifying the window and what to couple</h3>

        <p>
            A political window is opening with the expected government
            transition. To make use of it, the team needs to couple three
            things:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The problem</strong>: PFAS contamination as a public
                health and economic crisis—affecting citizens' health, burdening
                water utilities, threatening tourism and agriculture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The political receptivity</strong>: The incoming
                conservative government is likely receptive to economic
                arguments from affected industries and to constituent concerns
                about drinking water and health in their electoral districts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The solution</strong>: National support for the EU
                restriction proposal, which provides a balanced approach through
                the essential/non-essential use distinction.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The window is predictable (election dates are known) but
            time-limited (new governments are most receptive in their early
            months). The main strategic task is to make this coupling before
            industry reframing takes hold. If the new administration adopts the
            "essential uses are threatened" narrative first, it could weaken
            member state support for the EU process.
        </p>

        <p>
            Chapter 3 shows how the team translates this assessment into a
            concrete engagement strategy.

        <h2>2.4 Supporting Tools</h2>

        <p>
            The Policy Context Tool provides a high-level framework for
            assessment. Depending on your needs, you may want to use additional
            tools for more detailed analysis of specific components. Below is a
            selection of tools that practitioners have found useful.
        </p>

        <div class="tool-section">
            <h3>Horizon scanning</h3>

            <div class="tool-useful">
                <strong>Useful for</strong>: Identifying upcoming focusing
                events, anticipated political changes, and emerging policy

            </div>

            <p>
                <em>Horizon scanning</em> identifies emerging problems and
                opportunities at an early stage, allowing timely preparation of
                strategies. Through structured methods—trend analysis, expert
                consultation, literature review, and monitoring of scientific
                and policy signals—teams can detect early indicators of issues
                that may gain relevance over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                For conservation teams, this might mean regularly reviewing
                outputs from larger horizon scanning exercises (such as the
                annual scan published by Sutherland et al. in
                <em>Trends in Ecology & Evolution</em>), monitoring policy
                calendars for scheduled reviews and decisions, and tracking
                political developments that could open or close windows.

            <p>
                The <em>policymaker rating method</em> measures political
                support for a specific advocacy issue among a defined group of
                policymakers. It uses advocates' existing knowledge to rate
                policymakers on three scales:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Level of support</strong>: The policymaker's backing
                    of the issue, based on public behaviour or actions
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Level of influence</strong>: The policymaker's
                    ability to affect the issue

                <li>
                    <strong>Rater confidence</strong>: Confidence in the
                    accuracy of the ratings
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Ratings can be aggregated across policymakers and combined with
                contextual data (party affiliation, committee membership) for
                deeper analysis. The exercise can be repeated over time to track
                changes in political support.

            <p>
                An <em>evidence needs analysis</em> identifies what scientific
                data, research findings, or technical information already exists
                on a topic, and where gaps remain. This helps determine whether
                targeted research is needed to support a policy proposal.

                Approaches include structured literature reviews, gap mapping
                exercises, and participatory methods that bring together
                policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to identify
                priority information needs.
