                Conservation does not happen only in forests, rivers, or
                protected areas. It also unfolds in meeting rooms, legislative
                chambers, and public consultations—spaces where decisions shape
                what protection is possible, funded, or enforced. For many
                practitioners, meaningful conservation therefore requires
                stepping beyond on-the-ground action and into the complex world
                of policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                This chapter provides the foundation for that step. It explains
                how policy processes work, why they often feel unpredictable,
                and what challenges you will face when trying to influence them.
                Understanding these dynamics is essential before picking up the
                practical tools in Chapters 2, 3, and 4.

                    Policies move through stages—from agenda-setting to
                    formulation, adoption, implementation, and review. But
                    getting an issue onto the agenda in the first place is the
                    hard part. The Multiple Streams Framework explains how this
                    happens: problems, politics, and viable solutions must
                    converge in brief windows of opportunity.

                <li>
                    <strong>Policy windows are critical moments.</strong> Most
                    major policy changes happen when the right problem, the
                    right political conditions, and a viable solution come
                    together. These windows are often short and unpredictable,
                    which means preparation matters as much as timing.

                    What counts as policy success? A law passed? A commitment
                    made? Real implementation? Even when outcomes are clear,
                    multiple actors contribute to every result. Attribution to
                    any single organisation is inherently difficult.

                    <strong>Evidence alone doesn't change minds.</strong>
                    Scientific data matters enormously for credibility and for
                    making the case once decision-makers are receptive—but the
                    assumption that good evidence leads directly to good policy
                    is wrong. Evidence is necessary but not sufficient.

                    occurs at global, regional, national, and local levels
                    simultaneously. International commitments can create
                    pressure and reference points, but real change requires
                    national and local action.

        <h2>1.1 How Policy Processes Work</h2>

        <p>
            Understanding how policies are created is essential for those who
            seek to influence them. This section introduces the policy cycle—the
            stages that policies move through—and then focuses on
            agenda-setting, often the most critical and unpredictable stage. The
            Multiple Streams Framework helps explain why some issues gain
            political attention while others are ignored, and what it takes for
            change to happen.
        </p>

        <h3>The policy cycle</h3>

        <p>
            Policy processes differ across global, regional, national, and local
            systems, but they often follow a similar pattern. The
            <em>policy cycle</em> is a common way to describe this pattern,
            depicting policymaking as a series of stages:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Agenda-setting:</strong> Decision-makers identify and
                prioritise issues. This process is shaped by how problems are
                defined, political receptivity, and what solutions are
                available.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Policy formulation:</strong> Policies are drafted, often
                involving multiple rounds of consultation, research, and
                negotiation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Adoption:</strong> The policy is formally approved by
                the relevant authorities. The procedural steps vary across
                political systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Implementation:</strong> Adopted policies are translated
                into action through programmes, regulations, and administrative
                procedures.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Review and evaluation:</strong> The policy's
                implementation and effectiveness are assessed. Ideally, this
                feeds back into agenda-setting, and the cycle continues.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The cycle is often depicted as a circle to highlight its iterative
            nature. In reality, however, policymaking is rarely this linear.
            Stages overlap, reverse, or skip entirely. A policy may be adopted
            but never implemented. An issue may cycle through agenda-setting
            repeatedly without ever reaching adoption. The cycle is useful as a
            simplified model, but it does not capture the messy reality of how
            policy actually happens.
        </p>

        <h3>What shapes advocacy success</h3>

        <p>
            Policy engagement and the success of advocacy are shaped by three
            main factors:
        </p>

        <div class="three-factors">
            <p>
                <strong>General constraints</strong> are the systemic factors
                that shape civil society's ability to influence the policymaking
                process: the transparency of institutions, access to
                decision-makers, availability of funding, inclusive consultation
                mechanisms, and rules of procedure. These constraints can either
                limit or facilitate engagement. In some contexts, overcoming
                them is a strategic focus in itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Capacity to deliver</strong> refers to an organisation's
                or coalition's ability to engage effectively. This includes
                skills, knowledge, relationships, credibility, and resources.
                Strategies to enhance capacity include forming coalitions,
                internal capacity-building, and securing funding.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Policy windows</strong> are moments of opportunity when
                the conditions for policy change align. Their presence or
                absence significantly influences the effectiveness of engagement
                strategies. Understanding when and how windows open—and being
                prepared when they do—is essential for effective advocacy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            The rest of this section focuses on policy windows, as they are
            often the most critical and least understood factor.
        </p>

        <h3>Policy windows</h3>

        <p>
            Why do some issues gain political attention while others are ignored
            for years? Why does change sometimes happen suddenly after long
            periods of stagnation? The concept of <em>policy windows</em> helps
            explain these dynamics.
        </p>

        <p>
            A policy window is a moment when the conditions for policy change
            align—when advocates can push their issues onto the agenda and see
            action taken. John Kingdon's
            <em>Multiple Streams Framework</em> explains how these windows
            emerge through the interaction of three streams:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The problems stream:</strong> Various conditions compete for
            attention. A condition becomes a recognised <em>problem</em> when
            people believe something should be done about it. Problems gain
            attention through systematic indicators (data showing a condition is
            worsening), <em>focusing events</em> (crises, disasters, or scandals
            that shift attention), or feedback on existing policies (evidence
            that current approaches are failing).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The political stream:</strong> This stream follows its own
            dynamics—elections, shifts in public mood, changes in government,
            and pressure from interest groups. What happens here strongly
            affects which issues rise on the agenda. A new administration may
            bring entirely different priorities. A shift in public opinion may
            make previously ignored issues suddenly urgent.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The policy stream:</strong> Ideas, proposals, and solutions
            float around in what Kingdon calls a "primeval soup." Specialists
            develop and refine proposals, test them in various forums, and build
            support. Not all ideas survive—they are filtered by criteria such as
            technical feasibility, alignment with values, and anticipated
            political acceptability. The ideas that survive this process are
            ready to be picked up when an opportunity arises.
        </p>

        <p>
            In practice, these streams are interconnected—but thinking about
            them separately makes it easier to analyse what is happening and
            where to focus. A problem may be recognised, but no viable solution
            exists. A solution may be ready, but there is no political appetite
            for it. Political conditions may be favourable, but no one has
            framed the issue effectively.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
            <p>
                The Multiple Streams Framework was developed to explain
                agenda-setting in democratic systems, where public opinion
                influences elections and civil society can access
                decision-makers. In other political contexts, the dynamics may
                differ significantly. See the Introduction for a note on the
                scope of this guidebook.

        <h4>When do windows open?</h4>

        <p>
            Policy windows can be <strong>predictable</strong> or
            <strong>unpredictable</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Predictable windows</em> arise from scheduled events: the
                renewal of a law, an upcoming election, a Conference of the
                Parties, or a required policy review. Advocates can prepare for
                these in advance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Unpredictable windows</em> arise from crises, disasters,
                scandals, or unexpected political changes. These require the
                capacity to respond quickly.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Windows can also be opened by events in different streams:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A <strong>problem window</strong> opens when a new problem
                suddenly demands attention—a disaster, a damning report, a
                focusing event. Decision-makers search for solutions.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <strong>political window</strong> opens when political
                conditions shift—a new government takes office, public opinion
                changes, or an election creates pressure to act. Politicians
                look for problems to solve and commitments to make.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "You need this window of opportunity. And then change can happen
                really fast. This is something that keeps me going. Sometimes
                you think it will never change, and then suddenly everything
                comes together."
            </p>
            <p class="attribution">– Ulrike Kallee</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Coupling: linking problems, politics, and solutions</h4>

        <p>
            When a window opens, <em>coupling</em> becomes possible: linking a
            recognised problem to a viable solution in a favourable political
            moment. This coupling does not happen automatically. It requires
            advocates who have done the preparation—who have solutions ready,
            relationships in place, and the ability to frame issues in ways that
            resonate with the political moment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Partial couplings happen frequently: a problem is recognised but no
            solution is ready; a solution exists but there is no political
            appetite; politics and problems align but no one has a workable
            proposal. These partial couplings may build pressure over time, but
            they rarely produce immediate action. It is only when all three
            streams converge that the likelihood of policy change significantly
            increases.
        </p>

        <div class="case-study">
            <h4>Case Study: Protected Areas in Guatemala</h4>

            <p>
                In the mid-1980s, Guatemala stood at a crossroads. After sixteen
                years of military rule, the country transitioned to civilian
                governance with the election of President Vinicio Cerezo in
                1986. Only 2.5% of Guatemala's territory was protected, and
                forest cover had dropped from 68% to 39% in two decades.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The political window:</strong> The transition to
                democracy opened a window for policy change. A new constitution
                (1985) enabled democratic policy-making processes, including the
                regulation of environmental issues. Conservation remained
                non-controversial in Guatemalan politics, with weak and
                fragmented opposition from industries and landowners.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The problems stream:</strong> Rapid deforestation and
                environmental degradation were increasingly visible. Population
                growth and migration into forested areas placed pressure on
                remaining natural resources.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The political stream:</strong> Key conservation leaders
                had personal ties to influential political actors—Marco Cerezo
                (son of the President) and Jorge Cabrera (brother of the
                President of the Parliament). Globally, biodiversity
                conservation was gaining momentum, with IUCN pushing for
                ambitious protection targets.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The policy stream:</strong> National NGOs like
                Defensores de la Naturaleza had spent years preparing. They
                conducted biodiversity surveys, identified critical areas, and
                developed legislative proposals. International partners
                (including The Nature Conservancy) provided funding and
                technical expertise.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Coupling:</strong> When the window opened, advocates
                were ready. They had solutions prepared, relationships in place,
                and framing that resonated with the political moment.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>The outcome:</strong> In 1989, Guatemala passed the
                Protected Areas Law, establishing 42 protected areas covering
                nearly 25% of the country's territory. The Sierra de las Minas
                Biosphere Reserve became the first protected area in Latin
                America with management formally delegated to an NGO.

        <p>
            Windows can also close quickly. Action may be taken (successfully or
            not), and attention moves elsewhere. The political moment passes.
            Other issues crowd onto the agenda. The window that seemed open
            yesterday may be closed today.
        </p>

        <p>
            Chapter 3 explores strategies for preparing for and responding to
            policy windows: foreseeing opportunities, building coalitions,
            framing issues effectively, and persevering when windows are closed.

        <h2>1.2 Key Challenges in Policy Engagement</h2>

        <p>
            Understanding how policy works is only the first step. This section
            highlights three challenges that shape what is possible—and
            realistic—when engaging with policy processes. Recognising these
            challenges upfront helps set appropriate expectations and informs
            how you plan, act, and learn.
        </p>

        <h3>Success is hard to define and harder to claim</h3>

        <p>
            Policy engagement does not produce simple, measurable outcomes like
            a protected area boundary or a species count. Success in policy is
            layered, contested, and often ambiguous.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What counts as success?</strong> Consider the possibilities:
        </p>

        <div class="success-levels">
            <ul>
                <li>Getting an issue onto the political agenda</li>
                <li>Securing a public commitment from decision-makers</li>
                <li>Having language included in a policy document</li>
                <li>Getting a law passed</li>
                <li>Seeing that law funded and implemented</li>
                <li>Observing changes in behaviour on the ground</li>
                <li>Measuring impact on biodiversity or human wellbeing</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            Each of these represents a different level of success, and achieving
            one does not guarantee the next. A law can pass but remain unfunded.
            A commitment can be made but not honoured. Implementation can begin
            but stall.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Did success even happen?</strong> Policy change is often
            incremental, partial, or reversible. A provision gets weakened
            during negotiation. Implementation varies across jurisdictions. A
            new government reverses the policy entirely. What looked like
            success at one moment may not look like success later.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Did you contribute?</strong> Even when success is clear,
            many actors are involved in any policy outcome. NGOs, researchers,
            government champions, international pressure, media coverage, public
            opinion, and sheer timing all play roles. Attributing the outcome to
            any single organisation's efforts is inherently difficult—and often
            impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Would it have happened anyway?</strong> The counterfactual
            problem haunts all policy evaluation. Perhaps the window would have
            opened regardless. Perhaps another actor would have filled your
            role. This uncertainty is not a reason to disengage, but it does
            shape how we think about measuring success.
        </p>

        <p>
            These challenges do not mean success cannot be assessed. Chapter 4
            introduces approaches—such as outcome harvesting and contribution
            analysis—that help teams document what changed, understand their
            role, and learn for the future. The key is to plan for contribution,
            not control, and to build learning into your approach from the
            start.
        </p>

        <h3>Evidence alone doesn't change minds</h3>

        <p>
            Many conservation organisations engage where science and policy
            meet, advocating for the use of data to improve environmental
            outcomes. The assumption is intuitive: if decision-makers understood
            the evidence, they would make better choices.
        </p>

        <p>In practice, this assumption is often wrong.</p>

        <p>
            Political priorities are shaped by many factors: public opinion,
            electoral calculations, personal motivations, interest group
            pressure, and competing demands on attention. Evidence is one input
            among many, and it is rarely the decisive one. Decision-makers may
            have all the data and still not act—because the politics are not
            right, because other issues take priority, because acting would
            conflict with other goals.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "If the world as a whole followed scientific data, we would not
                continue heating up the planet and destroying biodiversity. So
                pure scientific evidence does not ultimately or directly lead to
                better environmental policies."
            </p>
            <p class="attribution">– Stefan Ferger</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This does not mean evidence is unimportant. It means its role is
            more specific than often assumed:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Evidence is essential for credibility.</strong> Walking
                into a meeting without supporting data can be counterproductive.
                Being able to back up your arguments makes them harder to
                dismiss.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Evidence matters most when windows are open.</strong>
                Once decision-makers are receptive and actively seeking
                solutions, evidence becomes highly valuable. It helps define
                problems, justify solutions, and demonstrate feasibility.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Evidence is critical for implementation.</strong> After
                a policy is adopted, technical expertise is needed for
                rule-making, guidance, and ensuring the original intent is
                carried out.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The messenger matters as much as the message.</strong>
                Who presents the evidence affects how it is received. Trusted
                voices, neutral parties, and community members may be more
                effective than advocacy organisations perceived as partial.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The challenge for practitioners is to use evidence
            strategically—understanding when it can make a difference and when
            other factors will dominate. Chapter 3 includes guidance on framing
            and timing evidence use as part of your engagement strategy.
        </p>

        <div class="evidence-box">
            <p class="evidence-label">Evidence in this guidebook</p>
            <p>
                Because evidence plays different roles at different stages, we
                highlight its use with boxes like this one throughout Chapters
                2, 3, and 4. These boxes help you understand when and how
                evidence matters—and when other factors will be more decisive.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Policy happens at multiple levels</h3>

        <p>
            Environmental issues do not respect jurisdictional boundaries.
            Migratory species cross borders. Climate change is global. Supply
            chains span continents. This means policy engagement often involves
            multiple levels of governance simultaneously.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Global and regional levels:</strong> International
            agreements—such as the Convention on Biological Diversity or
            UNFCCC—set frameworks, establish commitments, and create pressure
            for national action. They provide reference points that civil
            society can use to hold governments accountable. High-profile
            conferences generate media attention and political momentum.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>National level:</strong> This is where most binding law is
            made and where enforcement is possible. National politics,
            institutions, and capacity determine whether international
            commitments translate into action. A global target means little if
            national legislation does not follow.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Local level:</strong> Implementation happens on the ground.
            Local governments, communities, and land managers make daily
            decisions that determine whether policies achieve their intended
            impact.

            These levels interact in complex ways. International commitments can
            create pressure for national action. National frameworks can enable
            or constrain local implementation. Local experience can inform
            national policy and feed into international negotiations.

        <p>
            For practitioners, this means thinking strategically about where to
            engage:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Where is the decision actually made?</li>
            <li>Where is political receptivity highest?</li>
            <li>Where do you have relationships and credibility?</li>
            <li>
                How do actions at one level create pressure or opportunity at
                another?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Chapters 2 and 3 include tools for mapping the policy landscape
            across levels and choosing where to focus your efforts.

        <h2>1.3 Why You Need Structured Tools</h2>

        <p>
            The picture painted in this chapter may seem daunting. Policy
            processes are messy and unpredictable. Windows are brief and hard to
            anticipate. Success is ambiguous and hard to claim. Evidence alone
            is not enough. Multiple levels interact in complex ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            But these realities are not reasons for despair—they are reasons for
            preparation.
        </p>

        <p>
            If policy processes were predictable, you could wing it. Because
            they are not, you need to understand your context before you act.
            This is what Chapter 2 provides: tools for assessing the policy
            landscape, mapping stakeholders, and understanding where you are in
            the three streams.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you cannot control outcomes, you need to be strategic about where
            you focus. This is what Chapter 3 provides: approaches for setting
            goals, selecting strategies, building theories of change, and
            identifying enablers and barriers.
        </p>

        <p>
            If success is hard to measure, you need methods designed for
            complexity. This is what Chapter 4 provides: approaches like outcome
            harvesting and contribution analysis that help you learn from
            experience even when attribution is difficult.
        </p>

        <p>
            The rest of this guidebook is practical. It provides steps, tools,
            and worked examples—including a case study that runs through
            Chapters 2, 3, and 4. But the foundation is here: an understanding
            of how policy works and what makes it hard. With that foundation in
            place, the tools become meaningful.
